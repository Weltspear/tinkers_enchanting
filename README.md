A Tinkers' Construct addon which allows Tinkers' items to be enchanted.

# How does this work
Some enchantments have their TConstruct modifier counterpart, if such exists it will be applied to your tool if you enchant it in your anvil. If not then it will directly apply the enchantment. Enchantments which modify the attributes in any way may not work if they don't have a modifier counterpart. TConstruct items may only be enchanted in the anvil and they can be enchanted with any enchantment.

# Compatibility

## Apotheosis
Because Apotheosis doesn't actually change the max enchantment levels you have to change them in my config too.
